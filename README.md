# 03-Text-adventure
The goal of this assignment was to create a functional texted based adventure game. What I created is a silly game where the CIA abducts you and you need to name certain fast food restaurants in order to leave. Throughout working on this assignment I have learned how to create rooms, utilize python dictionaires, and how a game loop works.
